###  Pricing Strategy

We are confident in showing our transparent pricing, without the prospect requesting a quote. Highlight how **ADP **TotalSource (**ADPTS**) costs can add up.
| Pricing Tactic #1: Lack of transparency | **ADP **TotalSource only specifies what is included, but does not publicly post pricing. |  Ask about: |

|---|
Do you know what **ADP **charges you for each payroll? Is it consistent each month?
Are you able to budget and forecast easily? |
| Pricing Tactic #2: Add-ons & Hidden Fees | **ADPTS **touts many features that come at an additional cost: Global **PEO **and medical, recruiting & performance management, integrations, student loan repayment, time-tracking, and employee engagement. |  Ask about: |

|---|
Could I view an invoice from your last **ADP **bill? Are there line items for additional platforms or services?
Do you feel like you are consistently charged the same each month? |
| Pricing Tactic #3: Expensive Payroll | **ADP **charges a percent of each payroll run vs. a per employee per month charge. This means that payroll will get more costly as headcount and total payroll goes up for businesses. Additionally, one-off payments for bonuses, commissions, or off-cycle payments could add additional fees. | Ask about: |

|---|
Can I do a side-by-side comparison of **ADP**'s fees vs. ours?
How often do you plan to run payroll each month?|

 Spotting **ADP **Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against **ADP** - but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means | Objection Handling |
| Strategic Expert | **ADP **touts experts across HR, Benefits, Payroll, Workplace safety, Tax, and technology. What this actually means is that support is fragmented, and **SMB **customers without dedicated support need figure out which **ADP **team can answer their question. | See Objection Handling #3: **HR **Outsourcing |

| Global **EOR **Platform | **ADP **positions itself as a global solution: Global **EOR** & benefits, worldwide **HR **experts, integrations with global partners. However, they charge extra for **PEO **services for employees outside of a company's home country, medical benefits abroad, and many integrations. | See Objection Handling #5: Features for scaling businesses |

| 300 Custom Reports | **ADPTS **truly does have advanced analytics capabilities, and if you hear "300 reports" that can be customized, it's like **ADP **in the conversation. | See Objection Handling #4: Advanced Business Insights |

 Objection Handling

1. **ADP **has more health insurance carriers & better rates|
Details: **ADP **offers master policies with most large carriers (i.e., **BCBS**, Oxford, **UHC**, Aetna, etc), providing more optionality. **ADPTS **is also large enough to guarantee health insurance premiums for 18-24 months, which we have limitations on.
 How to Navigate
That’s true—but more doesn’t always mean better. We work with Aetna, Kaiser, and **UHC**—covering most employee preferences. And we’ll help you compare open market options too allowing you more flexibility with your plan options.
Is there a specific carrier that you must have?|

2. **ADP **has more integrations|
Details: 400+ Integrations compatible with **ADP **TotalSource, including **ATS**, time-tracking, and performance management options (JazzHR, Lattice, Workable). For all integrations, see **ADP**'s Marketplace("https://apps.adp.com/en-US/listing?filter=**FEATURED**#sort=relevancy&numberOfResults=12&f:PlatformFacet=%5BADP%20TotalSource%C2%AE%5D") filtered on platform = TotalSource.

 How to Navigate
Yes, but they often come with extra charges. Justworks strategically offers the core integrations growing small businesses rely on, including accounting, hiring, compliance, **IT **management and more.
**ADP **charges for many of its integrations, including user-based pricing for their QuickBooks integration. In contrast, Justworks' QuickBooks integration is free to use.
What integrations are most important to you? We likely can meet your needs and more.|

3. **ADP **offers advanced reporting|
Details: **ADP **offers robust and customizable report-builder for payroll, people management / **HR **Insights, and compensation benchmarking tools. 300+ pre-built reports including HR, Benefits, Time and attendance, Payroll, Recruitment. These can be customized. **ADP **DataCloud (Benchmarking)("https://apps.adp.com/en-US/apps/177424"): This add-on includes financial and compensation data aggregated from millions of workers across industries.
 How to Navigate
We offer customizable reports that are easy to read, export, and share. Plus, we’ve launched our People Analytics tool to offer deep insights for workforce planning and budgeting.
Do you have any advanced needs for reporting that you’re worried we can’t meet?|

4. **ADP **has more features for scaling businesses|
Details: Justworks customers anticipating growth may proactively leave us for **ADP**. They like that they can graduate from **ADPTS **as their **PEO **to an **ASO **product (**ADP **has several options).
 How to Navigate
Our **ATS **integrations (Greenhouse, JazzHR, and Lever) and our accounting integrations (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Sage Intacct) should meet the needs of companies with small-medium growth goals.
Additionally, our all-on-one solution for domestic and global employees should make it easier for you to hire, onboard, and offboard new team members.
Are you planning on growing beyond 100 employees this year? Or are there specific processes you're worried won't scale?|

## ✅ Leading Questions & Talking Points

| Leading Question to Ask | Talking Points |
Costs
How much is the current solution costing you? And how important is transparent costs to you?|**ADP**'s pricing model has reported as costly; often driven by their pricing model which charges companies a percent of each payroll run. This adds up as your company grows, if you have frequent payroll periods, or off-cycle payments for things like bonuses and commissions.
**ADP **also may charge you for hidden fees on integrations, setup, or off-cycle payments.
Unlike **ADP**, Justworks provides transparent pricing, allowing you to budget confidently.
If you'd like we're happy to do a side-by-side comparison of any health insurance or invoices you have?|
Customer Service
How important is customer service in running your business? |We've heard from companies that **ADP**'s lack of responsive customer service caused major disruptions in their payroll operations and they don't directly support employees when issues arise.
Justworks **PEO**'s customer support is available 24/7 through multiple channels, including Slack. We also provide dedicated Onboarding support for international customers.
Your employees will also be supported by our customer success teams and have access to other resources including an Employee Help Center to self-service issues. For team members enrolled in a Justworks health insurance plan, they have access to an Employee Assistance Program (**EAP**) through Health Advocate as well.
The quality of our customer support is best-in-class, proven by receiving the 2025 Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service.("https://www.justworks.com/press/press-release/justworks-wins-gold-stevie-award-in-2025-stevie-awards")|
Made for Small Business
What are your businesses growth plans this year? Do you plan to expand your team beyond 100 employees?

|While **ADP **offers some small business solutions, their customer support model, pricing, and technology better meets the needs of mid-sized to enterprise businesses.
Justworks' primary audience is small businesses <100 employees and US-Based companies looking to expand their team's globally. This is reflected in both our product roadmaps and customer success models.
Our platform is intuitive and user-friendly, so you won't need to spend time and resources training employees to use the tool and administrators generally have all the things they need to manage payroll, benefits, compliance, and their team in one user-friendly platform.
Most users are able to self-service their needs on Justworks and if not, you can get support directly from our in-house customer success teams.
Would you like a demo?|
Global Hiring
Do you have team members outside the U.S. or are you considering hiring globally in the future? |**ADP **does not offer an in-house **EOR **meaning you likely will need to work with two of their solutions to manage your entire team—adding costs and additional admin work.
We offer **EOR **services and the ability to pay international contractors in major talent markets.
I’d love to set up a call with you to learn more, and then loop in one of our international experts.|
Values
Are you aware of Justworks social impact programs and equitable benefits?|Justworks offers multiple programs to help level the playing field for small businesses like:
Just Thrive("https://www.justworks.com/lp/just-thrive"): Creates more equitable access to basic business infrastructure by providing cash credits for minority-owned and woman-owned SMBs.
Justworks Spring Forward("https://www.justworks.com/springforward") fund provides grants to nonprofits that help to create more equitable access for underserved or underrepresented populations.
Additionally, Justworks offers premium benefits through partner like Kindbody and Talkspace to ensure that regardless if an employee is looking for fertility care or mental health services, we always have an option for them. **ADPTS **offers the basic medial, dental, vision, and disability & life insurance, but falls short in mental health and fertility care.|

 International offering

| How Justworks International competes with **ADP** (through Globalization Partners) |
|---|
What international service offerings do they have, if any?|Global payroll and a platform to manage global payments.
**EOR **services through a partnership with Globalization Partners - **EOR**: basic tolls for the company to hire abroad - **EOR **Prime: tools and expert guidance - International contractors - Platform: Remote HR, time tracking, expense management, compensation explorer, contract generator - Immigration services - Recruiting services - Entity setup management|
| Do they have an all-in-one platform experience for US/global teams? If yes, is it directly or through third party partnerships? | They don't have an all-in-one platform, but they offer **EOR **services through Globalization Partners. |
What do we know about the pricing of their offering?|- **EOR**: starts at 15% employee's monthly salary
- International contractors: $39 **PCPM**
- Quote is required for the following: **EOR **Prime, Platform (Remote HR, time tracking, expense management, compensation explorer, contract generator), Immigration Services, Recruiting Services, Entity Setup Management|
How do we position ourselves to win?|Our international compliance support is more reliable than **ADP**'s
Our pricing is transparent and straightforward
Our customer service and onboarding teams are best-in-class
Our all-in one solution eliminates the need for multiple vendors
Justworks is tailored to serve the needs of small businesses|

### Justworks Payroll Comparison

| How Justworks Payroll competes with **ADP** |
|---|
Objection Handling (Justworks Payroll)|**ADP **has more health insurance carriers & better rates
Due to their scale and time in the market, **ADP **offers more optionality in their carriers as well as the ability to guarantee premiums for 18-24 months. Justworks Payroll (open market plans brokered via Justworks) offers 4 carriers. If the prospect is looking to shop for plans Justworks **PEO **may be a better fit (see Objection Handling)
**ADP **has more integrations
**ADP **offers a significant number of integrations while Justworks Payroll only offers accounting integrations. Ask the prospect if they anticipate using integrations and are willing to pay additionally to access them. If the prospect has a strong need for integrations such as **HR **integrations or additional accounting integrations Justworks **PEO **may be a better fit.
**ADP **has **HR **Outsourcing
**ADP **has dedicated **HR **outsourcing specialists who provide a wide range of **HR **services from strategy and employee relations, to administrative payroll and compliance tasks. This is attractive to fast-growing teams. Justworks Payroll does not offer direct **HR **services, if the prospect has a need for this service and is willing to pay additionally they may be a good fit for the **PEO **with access to **HR **consultants and 24/7 support (see Objection Handling).
**ADP **offers advanced business insights
**ADP **offers robust and customizable report-builder for payroll, people management / **HR **Insights, and compensation benchmarking tools including 300+ pre-built reports. If your prospect needs advanced reporting capabilities, Justworks **PEO **may be a good fit for them (see Objection Handling).|
| What is their customer support model? | **ADP **has a disconnected service model, with different contacts for payroll, insurance, and HR. Smaller customers often spend significant time and energy to get the support they need. |
|---|
How do our Payroll integrations and technology match up against theirs?|Integrations: **ADP **offers a robust integrations marketplace with a large number of integrations across many categories.
Technology: **ADP **technology is reported to be outdated and non-intuitive.|
How does our Payroll offering win against them?|Our technology is modern and user-friendly
Our platform is intuitive and user-friendly, so you won't need to spend time and resources training employees to use the tool. **ADP**’s legacy platform is not intuitive and does not meet the standards of a modern workforce. Coupled with lackluster onboarding support, this presents platform usability challenges for customers based on G2 reviews.
Our pricing is transparent and straightforward
Justworks breaks out and provides visibility into all service/insurance costs, making it easy to identify and pay for only what you need. **ADP **is transparent with pricing - new customers must speak to a representative to understand product packaging and pricing and many users report confusion about their invoices and paying for services they don’t need.
Our world-class customer service far outperforms **ADP**'s disconnected service model
Our support has won Stevie Awards across multiple categories for six consecutive years, the world’s top honors for sales and consumer service. Our customer support is always human and always employed by Justworks - we never outsource your calls. Support response within 1 business day. Customer Satisfaction Score (**CSAT**): 4.8/5.0.|

###  Pricing Strategy

We are confident in showing our transparent pricing, without the prospect requesting a quote. Our conversations should revolve around how the cost for Insperity can add up. Here are some features that set us apart:
24/7 Support
Mental Health & Fertility Benefits
**PTO **Management
| Pricing Tactic #1: No transparent pricing | Insperity does not list basic pricing on its website. The company charges a per employee fees based on your service needs and company size, but you’ll need to contact Insperity to get a personalized quote. |  Point out that if a prospect is interested in pricing, they must request a quote. |

|---|---|
| Pricing Tactic #2: Lowball **HI **quotes | Insperity markets better **HI **rates/low renewals, but make up for the difference in other parts of their business due to self-insured plans. |  Point out that renewals are unpredictable. We offer multi-year rate caps. Also, our overall pricing is upfront and competitive. |

See sample Insperity quote here("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19TXI5Gq6NRUBqi67NWEU8Q0NsRRVAbHF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101754534760243224360&rtpof=true&sd=true")
 Spotting Insperity Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against Insperity - but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means | Objection Handling |
| Premier | Insperity Premier is the name of their self-service hub, where employees check paystubs, request time off, and manage benefits. | The Justworks hub is what employees see when they login. They are able to check paystubs, request time off and manage benefits efficiently and intuitively. |

### **HCM**

| (Human Capital Management) | Insperity advertises itself as an **HCM** (human capital management) platform. This refers to an all-in-one platform where employees can manage tasks related to hiring, payroll, benefits etc. | See Objection Handling #1: Ask the prospect which features are most important to them, and steer the conversation to that. We are competitive when it comes to payroll and benefits, and have a Greenhouse integration to support hiring. |

 Objection Handling

1. Insperity has more integrations|
Insperity sells themselves as "all in one". They have a built-in proprietary **ATS **and performance management systems (PerformSmart).|

 How to Navigate
| Response Point #1 | Identify which integrations the prospect cares about. We have found that our partner list more than suits the vast majority of our prospects. Odds are, we have them covered. |

| Response Point #2 | Explain the hidden costs of add-ons. Insperity often charges customers additional fees for integrations that are often needed for an all-in-one **PEO **solution. Justworks' Accounting and Hiring integrations are free. |

2. Insperity has more advanced business insights|
Advanced reporting - data analytics and insights, customization:
People Analytics solution powered by Visier lets you create any report using any employee data point from connected apps.|

 How to Navigate
| Response Point #1 | Inform prospects that Justworks' People Analytics tool is powered by the same data partner (Visier). Justworks' People Analytics tool transforms workforce data into actionable insights with intuitive reports and engaging visual insights. |

|---|
Response Point #2

|Ask prospects what business insights they care about. Our new analytics capabilities will include:
Workforce, benefits, finance, and **PTO **data to make data-driven business decisions
On-demand access to data and insights centralized within the Justworks platform
Templated reports that can be customized, saved, exported, and securely shared with other **HR **admins
Custom Reporting allows you to create, save, and share tailored reports to enhance decision-making and efficiency.|

3. Insperity offers lower health insurance rates and more carriers|
Insperity self insures medical up to $10 million. Because of that, they have a higher risk appetite. They can pass along lower rates and bake them in elsewhere.|

 How to Navigate
| Response Point #1 | Admin costs more than make up for the lower rates. Talk through our overall pricing strategy, and steer aware from solely focusing on health insurance premiums. |

Justworks Spring Forward("https://www.justworks.com/springforward") fund provides grants to nonprofits that help to create more equitable access for underserved or underrepresented populations|

Our customer service and onboarding teams are best-in-class
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Customer service
How important is customer service for you and your employees?|Our Customer Service is world class - clients love the 24/7 US-based support and Account Managers.
Our team is award-winning and has been recognized through the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service("https://www.justworks.com/about/press/archive/justworks-wins-2023-gold-stevie-award"), the world’s top honors for customer service and sales professionals. Justworks recently won:
Gold for Best Use of Technology in Customer Service
Silver for Customer Service Department of the Year - Computer Software
Silver for Achievement in Customer Service Automation
Bronze for Achievement in Customer Experience|
Are you aware of how Insperity provides customer support? |There’s only chat and email support, limited support for employers, and 8 AM -8 **PM **for employees.
Many customers report challenges with customer service on G2 reviews:
“All in, we have something like 15 support people for our account and each performs like 6% of our needs and none knows what the others are doing or have done.”
"Attempting to call them results in being put on hold forever. If you do wait through the hour+ wait queue, the people who finally pick up are useless."|
Onboarding
| How much bandwidth do you have to support your software set-up and initial implementation? | Insperity’s platform has the potential of being too complicated for small businesses that prefer simplicity and ease of use. It requires a lot of configuration if you want it to work the way it’s sold. |

Our pricing is transparent and straightforward
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Pricing
Are you aware of how Insperity prices solutions and integrations?|They are not transparent on integration pricing and there are a lot of additional add-ons (Insperity Quote)("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19TXI5Gq6NRUBqi67NWEU8Q0NsRRVAbHF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103218733968800355126&rtpof=true&sd=true")
Insperity has a "co-employment risk charge" that is **PEPM**. It hides the true cost of their admin charges.
Customer has reported a frustrating fee structure via G2 reviews:
"We used Insperity for under one year. They charged astronomical fees that were hidden and they couldn't explain them. It was an expensive and time-consuming mistake to use Insperity."|

We win against Rippling on these fronts|
Our reputation & values are highly ranked in the **PEO **industry|
Our customer service and onboarding teams are best-in-class|
Our pricing is transparent and straightforward|
Our compliance support is more reliable than Rippling's|

## ⚠️ Why We Lose

Justworks features best serve small businesses, and mid-size to enterprise companies might like that Rippling can customize **HR **solutions|

###  Competitor Profile

rippling.com.png
Rippling•rippling.com("http://rippling.com/")

Rippling provides a comprehensive workforce management system that integrates HR, IT, and finance applications into a single platform, streamlining business operations and enhancing employee management.
Company Type:Private
Location:2570 Folsom St, San Francisco, **CA **94110-2622, US
**NPS **score (Jan 2025):-39
Founded:2016
Industry:Professional Services
Parent company:Rippling
Employee Count:1,750
Notable acquisitions:RunX, FuzzBuzz, Scribe, Metaco

###  Pricing Strategy

Unlike Rippling, we are confident in showing our transparent pricing, without the prospect requesting a quote. To deposition on price, highlight how Rippling costs can add up. We include the below features our Basic plan, and Rippling doesn't:
24/7 Support
**HR **Consulting
**PTO **Management
Pricing Tactic #1: Semi-transparency|On its website, Rippling only shows pricing for their base plan, Rippling Unity, which includes payroll processing, direct deposit and onboarding tools.

| Rippling charges extra for other services like benefits administration and applicant tracking (**ATS**). |  Inform the prospect that if they're interested in insurance and benefits, they must 1) request a quote and 2) figure out how much their modular plan will cost. |
| Pricing Tactic #2: Hidden costs | Rippling often takes the lowest-cost approach to their pricing. The Rippling Unity plan is comparable to our payroll-only product. |  Show a true apples-to-apples comparison and highlight the full list of services that our Basic plan includes, compared to Rippling Unity. Prospects will see how much more they get with Justworks, and that we are transparent with pricing. |

See sample Rippling quote here("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WdnZEWT4DertQsfvMnY4PFRtk1Af3enGVd0Gw7Pq73o/edit?usp=sharing")
 Spotting Rippling Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against Rippling - but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means | Objection Handling |
| Modularity | Rippling calls their plans as "modular" which means they charge for add-on features. Prospects have to do the heavy lifting to get the full picture - they rely on their Rippling rep to pitch them services that they may not want, then must determine which features they actually need. | See Objection Handling #1: Integrations & |

Objection Handling #2: Features for scaling businesses|

| Device Management | Rippling offers a device management feature, which allows customers to remotely order, configure, and warehouse employees' computers. The hardware portion of their **IT **Provisioning capabilities. | See Objection Handling #4: **IT **Provisioning |

 Objection Handling

1. Rippling has more integrations|
Rippling prides themselves on their integrations and as a tech first company, with 500+ Integrations (changes in Rippling app flows through to other systems), including **ATS **and performance management options (Greenhouse, Lattice, Culture Amp). System of record for workforce products. Customizable workflow automations (i.e., automated email reminders for specific tasks).
Visit the Rippling App Shop("https://www.rippling.com/app-shop") for details on specific integrations.|
 How to Navigate
| Response Point #1 | Identify which integrations the prospect cares about. We have found that our partner list more than suits the vast majority of our prospects. Odds are, we have them covered. |

| Response Point #2 | Explain the hidden costs of add-ons. Rippling often charges customers additional fees for integrations that are often needed for an all-in-one **PEO **solution. Justworks' Accounting and Hiring integrations are free. |

2. Rippling has more features for scaling businesses|
For growing businesses, Rippling sells on:
“90 second onboarding process” including offer letter, **ATS **integration, and tech provisioning
Ease of switching to their **ASO **product once they’ve outgrown the **PEO **model|
 How to Navigate
Response Point #1|Ask about your prospects intent to grow. Our **ATS **integration with Greenhouse should meet the needs with companies with small-medium growth goals.

|
| Response Point #2 | Explain the hidden costs of add-ons. Rippling charges on a per feature basis for many integrations including **ATS **integrations. |

|---|

3. Rippling has advanced business insights|
Advanced reporting - data analytics and insights, customization:
New Unity Analytics product("https://www.rippling.com/blog/introducing-rippling-unity") lets you create any report using any employee data point from connected apps. As well as role and relationship-based permissions and approvals.
Hundreds of ready-to-use reporting “recipes,” with search capabilities|
 How to Navigate
| Response Point #1 | Justworks' People Analytics tool transforms workforce data into actionable insights with intuitive reports and engaging visual insights. |

|---|
Response Point #2

|Ask prospects what business insights they care about. Our People Analytics capabilities include:
Workforce, benefits, finance, and **PTO **data to make data-driven business decisions
On-demand access to data and insights centralized within the Justworks platform
Templated reports that can be customized, saved, exported, and securely shared with other **HR **admins
Custom Reporting allows you to create, save, and share tailored reports to enhance decision-making and efficiency.|

4. Rippling offers **IT **provisioning|
**IT **Device Management, **SSO**, and App Provisioning tends to “wow” the smaller <20 employee companies who don’t have as much bandwidth to deal with **IT **setup during **EE **onboarding|
 How to Navigate
| Response Point #1 | Ask about their hiring plans. If they don’t plan to hire a large number of people, you can build out your pitch around our other differentiators to determine whether **IT **provisioning is a deal breaker or just a nice-to-have. |

| Response Point #2 | We have a lot of customers who’ve used Electric **AI **for their **IT **provisioning. Since that’s Electric’s bread and butter, they have a lot more functionality and their support is much more specialized than Rippling’s. Rippling tries to do a little bit of everything, and while that sounds nice in theory, in practice, it can mean that the service level isn’t as strong. |

Objection Handling (Justworks Payroll)|Rippling has more integrations
Rippling prides themselves on their integrations and as a tech first company, with 500+ Integrations (changes in Rippling app flows through to other systems), including **ATS **and performance management options (Greenhouse, Lattice, Culture Amp). System of record for workforce products. Customizable workflow automations (i.e., automated email reminders for specific tasks). If the prospect has a strong need for additional integrations Justworks **PEO **may be a better fit (see Objection Handling)
Rippling has advanced business insights
Rippling offers advanced reporting - data analytics and insights, customization etc. If your prospect needs advanced reporting capabilities, Justworks **PEO **may be a good fit for them (see Objection Handling).
Rippling offers **IT **provisioning
Rippling offers **IT **Device Management, **SSO**, and App Provisioning which  tends to “wow” the smaller <20 employee companies who don’t have as much bandwidth to deal with **IT **setup during **EE **onboarding. However, if the prospect doesn't plan to hire a large number of people, you can build out your pitch around our other differentiators to determine whether **IT **provisioning is a deal breaker or just a nice-to-have.

Rippling tries to do a little bit of everything, and while that sounds nice in theory, in practice, it can mean that the service level isn’t as strong.|
What is their customer support model?|There’s only chat and email support, limited Support for customers spending below $70K **ARR**, and no support for employees. Many customers report challenges with customer service on G2 reviews:
“You’re on your own if you need help”, “One small issue ripples into a bigger one because of unresponsive email support and delays”.
"Customer service is non-existent."
"Tax withholding and exemptions are impossible to set up."
"There’s no Help Center and barely available Support. Very little in-app guidance."|
How do our Payroll integrations and technology match up against theirs?|Technology: Like Justworks, Rippling is an easy to use tech-forward solution.
Integrations: Rippling offers an extensive integration network with over 600 “out-of-the-box” integrations plus developer kits to create and publish custom integrations. Justworks Payroll only offers accounting integrations.|
How does our Payroll offering win against them?|Our customer service and onboarding teams are best-in-class
Our support has won Stevie Awards across multiple categories for six consecutive years, the world’s top honors for sales and consumer service. Our customer support is always human and always employed by Justworks - we never outsource your calls. Support response within 1 business day. Customer Satisfaction Score (**CSAT**): 4.8/5.0.
Our pricing is transparent and straightforward
Rippling is not transparent on integration pricing and there are a lot of additional add-ons. Rippling also uses annual contracts, not a “pay only what you use” concept|

TrustPilot Review
Rippling was given a 1-star review on TrustPilot
If you value transparency, reliable billing, and honest business practices — look elsewhere. My experience has been riddled with unexplained charges, evasive support, and tactics I’d never expect from a company of this size. The product has promise, but it’s overshadowed by how the company operates behind the scenes. This isn’t just a “bad experience” — it’s a warning.

We win against TriNet on these fronts|
Built for small business|
Our transparent, flexible pricing|
Our world-class, 24/7 customer service|
Our values align with customer values - as evidenced through our benefit offerings and funds supporting SMBs|

###  Competitor Profile

trinet.png
TriNet•trinet.com("http://trinet.com/")

Company Type:Public
Location:210 Park Ave, Oklahoma City, **OK **73102-5636, US
Parent Company:TriNet Group, Inc.
Founded:1988
Notable Acquisitions:Zenefits, Clarus R+D, Little Bird, Expense Cloud
Employee Count:367,700
**NPS **score (Jan 2025):0

###  Pricing Strategy

We are confident in showing our transparent pricing, without the prospect requesting a quote. Highlight how TriNet uses "all-in-one solution" pricing to charge customers for features they don't need.
| Pricing Tactic #1: Lack of transparency | TriNet claims to offer flexible pricing, but this just means they are inconsistent with pricing. |  Point out that TriNet does not publicly post its pricing, while Justworks does. TriNet prospects need to meet with a consultant who will gather information both objective (company size) and subjective (state of the business) to provide a custom quote. |

|---|---|
| Pricing Tactic #2: No a la carte pricing | TriNet will try to sell prospects on the importance of a a complete solution as justification for their lack of standalone offerings. | Customers may end up paying for more than what they need, because TriNet offers a large suite of services with no way to opt-out of unneeded solutions. |

See sample TriNet quote here("https://justworkshr.enterprise.slack.com/files/ULE1TN55F/F05SUP8HQ5C/trinet_aetna__24.pdf")
 Spotting TriNet Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against TriNet - but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means | Objection Handling |
| All-in-One | TriNet is a jack of all trades and master of none. They position themselves as an “All-in-one” **HR **solution with an “all-in-one” platform. The reality is they don’t specialize in small biz (they acquired Zenefits to bolster their **SMB **customer base) and rely heavily on acquisitions and partnerships to expand their services. | See Objection Handling #3: Document Management |

| Connect 360 | This is TriNet’s program for 360 **HR **coverage. It includes a dedicated supported professional and on-demand coverage. However, you can only use the in-product chat for a Help Desk 24/7. Specialized experts are available 6 AM - 12 **PM ET**. | See Objection Handling #1: **HR **Consulting |

| Employee Satisfaction | TriNet positions their PEOs as a driver of employee satisfaction and retention. However, their entire webpage dedicated to SMBs("https://www.trinet.com/peo-overview") speaks broadly to the benefits of a **PEO **and is not specific to TriNet. Even the success metrics (**CSAT **and **ROI**) are based on national **PEO **results - not TriNet’s! | N/A |

 Objection Handling

1. TriNet offers dedicated and on-demand **HR **Consulting|
Connect 360 is TriNet's branded **HR **Consulting services, including a 1:1 with an assigned **HR **expert, in addition to their assigned relationship manager. **HR **Topics covered include: Payroll, Benefits, Compliance, **HR **Policy, Employee Relations, Performance Management, Hiring, Compensation, and more.
Admins can request **HR **support on-demand:
Phone and email 6 AM – 12:00 **AM ET** (3 AM–9 **PM PT**)
In-product chat is 24/7 (Through a help desk)|
 How to Navigate
Response Point|Ask prospects what type of support is most important to them. Do they prioritize customer service?Justworks offers award-winning("https://www.justworks.com/about/press/archive/justworks-wins-2023-gold-stevie-award"), 24/7 U.S.-based customer service.
In contrast, TriNet's day-to-day customer service is highly depending on the assigned Relationship Manager, and their 24/7 capabilities extend only to their in-product chat feature, where associates predominantly provide scripted answers to simple questions. TriNet's escalation process for complex issues is slow and inefficient.
While TriNet does provide Human Capital Consulting for **HR **training, and Connect 360 for employee relations, performance management, talent acquisition, and compensation topics, their day-to-day service model is a detractor for many existing customers.
For more, see Leading Questions & Talking Points - Customer Service.("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/51316/#")|

2. TriNet offers software tools for hiring|
TriNet Hire is TriNet's homegrown applicant tracking system. Admins can create new job posts, push them to popular career boards, and access candidate information. They can also customize their workflows.
Background checks powered by Global **HR **Research.|
 How to Navigate
| Response Point | Identify whether the prospect is using any Applicant Tracking Systems already. Justworks integrates with Greenhouse Recruiting, Lever, and JazzHR (coming soon). |
|---|

3. Advanced Document Management capabilities|
TriNet didn't build a document management system, but they do offer Document Management powered by Box.
Customers can request documentation, validate employee certifications, track uploads.|

Response Point|Ask your prospect if they actually use Box for document storage. Chances are, they're using Google Drive and it's working just fine for their needs.
It’s easy for small businesses to overpay for hidden, unneeded features like this one. TriNet has recently started offering lots of new product features via partnerships. This means that they're beholden to partners to deliver revenue, and their "all-in-one" pricing allows TriNet to charge customers for these features "Powered by X partner" - whether the customer needs it or not.|

At the time of me writing this rating, Trinet's rating is 1.2, and to be honest, that is too high. Trinet's chief priority in every customer interaction is to maximize their profit, at all costs. Their addition of fees and constant price hikes were the drivers that caused us to leave them. But the straw that broke the camel's back, and caused this review was their charging of an early...

## ✅ Leading Questions & Talking Points

Executive Summary here.("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/51316/#")

Justworks is focused on small businesses.
| Leading Question to Ask | Talking Points |
Small Business Focus
Did you know that 80% of Justworks customers have under 20 WSEs?|Justworks is solidly focused on serving the smallest businesses in the U.S., while many PEOs like TriNet drift upmarket.
TriNet claims to focus on SMBs, but they define SMBs as 5-1,000 employees. They’re actually designing for mid-sized companies and have turned on partnerships as a way to add bells & whistles that small businesses don't want or need.
Here's what some small businesses had to say:
"After evaluating 10+ PEOs for our small start up, I can highly recommend both Justworks or Rippling, depending on your growth goals. I would run far away from TriNet which will leave you open to multiple tax and law implications while ignoring customer needs." - **SMB** <50 employees("https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/trinet-review-7656937")
"Too oversized for small business... If you're a large company, you are likely to see more benefits from TriNet over similar PEOs that are smaller/leaner. As a small business, they were just 'too big for their britches.'" - **SMB** <50 employees("https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/trinet-review-6850192")|

Justworks won't charge you for things you don't need.
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Pricing
Are you aware of how TriNet prices their solutions and services?|Justworks breaks out and provides visibility into all service/insurance costs, making it easy to identify and pay for only what you need.
TriNet claims to offer flexible pricing, but this just means they only provide personalized quotes. Customers may end up paying for more than what they need, because TriNet offers a large suite of services with no way to opt-out of unneeded solutions.
No a la carte services: TriNet claims it's important to have a "complete solution in place to get the most out of our services," but this just means they don't allow standalone offerings
Lack of transparency: Prospects need to meet with a seller for a custom quote. TriNet will assess qualitative criteria like "the state of your business" in their quote process.
Customer review on G2:
"We've been with them less than a year and we've already had two price increases." - **SMB** <50 employees("https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/trinet-review-8237316")
"The cost continues to increase, which may make it necessary for us to change vendors." - **SMB** <50 employees("https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/trinet-review-2433554")|

Our customer service is best-in-class
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Customer Service
How important is customer service for you and your employees?|Our customer service is world-class - clients love the 24/7 US-based support and Account Managers.
Our team is award-winning and has been recognized through the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service("https://www.justworks.com/about/press/archive/justworks-wins-2023-gold-stevie-award"), the world’s top honors for customer service and sales professionals. Justworks recently won:
Gold for Best Use of Technology in Customer Service
Silver for Customer Service Department of the Year - Computer Software
Silver for Achievement in Customer Service Automation
Bronze for Achievement in Customer Experience|
What is your expected resolution time for payroll and compliance issues?|Once onboarding is complete, customers report slow response with customer service on G2 reviews:
"While its easy to submit a ticket this team could likely be expanded as the response times here are a bit slow sometimes. On a few occasions I have waited a week or more before getting a response. When this happens I loop in my account reps." - **SMB** <50 employees("https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/trinet-review-8394786")
"The customer service has been tricky. The most helpful correspondence has been with the chat bot/center." - **SMB** <50 employees("https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/trinet-review-7875773")
"Our specific Customer Relationship Manager would reply to emails 2-3 weeks after an initial email was sent. Eventually, we reached out to a director after a particularly egregious mistake Trinet had made. We escalated the issue to a director. Upon getting on the call with her, she had not been briefed and decided to look into our Salesforce account while sitting on the call with us. At all levels, there seems to be no true assistance. The Customer Support responds quickly, but only responds in scripts and are not actually problem-solving as much as they are script typers." - **SMB** <50 employees("https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/trinet-review-7656937")|

Justworks' values align to yours
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Detail |

Values
What types of benefits do you need to see in your benefits package to make sure employees have equal access to care?
|Justworks prioritizes equitable and accessible benefits - we provide insurance through national carriers and providers that often have virtual care options.
We work with partners like Kindbody, Talkspace, and One Medical to ensure that regardless if an employee is looking for fertility care or mental health services, we always have an option for any employee type.
While TriNet does offer reimbursements for expenses related to medical travel, education, disaster relief, and child adoption, they do not offer employers a benefit to cover mental health or fertility costs for employees.|
Are you aware of Justworks social impact programs?

|Justworks offers social impact programs to support SMBs:
Just Thrive ("https://www.justworks.com/lp/just-thrive")creates more equitable access to basic business infrastructure by providing cash credits for minority-owned and woman-owned SMBs
Justworks Spring Forward("https://www.justworks.com/springforward") fund provides grants to nonprofits that help to create more equitable access for underserved or underrepresented populations|

Our Compliance Support is more reliable than Gusto's|

###  Competitor Profile

gusto.com.png
Gusto•gusto.com("http://gusto.com/")

Gusto is a modern, online people platform that helps small businesses take care of their teams. They offer full-service payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, expert HR, and team management tools. With a mission to create a world where work empowers a bet...
Estimated Annual Revenue:$500M-$1B
Founded:2011
**NPS **score (Jan 2025):3
Raised:$746,100,000
Employee Count:2,400
Company Type:Private
Location:500 3rd St, San Francisco, **CA **94107-1818, US

###  Pricing Strategy

Gusto recently informed its customers that the pricing for its Simple plan will increase effective March 1, 2025. This is not yet communicated on their website.
Current pricing: $40 + $6 **PEPM**
Updated pricing: $49 + $6 **PEPM**
Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 2.28.27 PM.png
Although both Justworks and Gusto have transparent pricing, Justworks' pricing structure is simpler to understand because our plans already include the essential add-ons that Gusto customers would need to consider separately.
24/7 Support
Compliance Support
Supplementary Benefits
| Pricing Tactic #1: Customer support | On Gusto's website, priority customer support is an add-on that is only available to their Plus plan (+$8/mo per person). Their Simple plan has no access to this add-on. |  24/7 customer support is already included in the Basic plan for Justworks **PEO**. In addition, Justworks' 24/7 customer support is far superior to Gusto's Priority support, which only allows the customer to be connected with the support team faster and is still only available during business hours. Justworks' customer support also outshines Gusto's in its expertise for benefits administration and compliance. |

|---|---|
Pricing Tactic #2: Lack of transparency for Premium plan|Gusto's Premium plan, which is its highest tier package, has no transparent pricing. A prospect needs to talk to Sales to get a custom quote, and it could come with hidden costs that may not be aware to the prospect.

|  Most of the features that are included in the Premium plan for Gusto come already included in the Justworks **PEO **Plus plan. In addition, we have a totally transparent pricing structure for our Plus plan without needing to worry about any hidden costs or complex add-ons. |
|---|

 Spotting Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against Gusto—but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means |
| Payroll & Small Business | Gusto centers their messaging around being the #1 Payroll software provider for small businesses. They support this with mentions from various channels (G2, Nerdwallet, **US **news, and TechRepublic). |

| All in one platform | Gusto positions their platform as an easy-to-use, all-in-one platform that removes administrative burdens for their customers. |

View Executive Summary here("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/53938/#")

1. Gusto has more add-ons that help businesses customize their plans|
When it comes to pricing, Gusto emphasizes the various ways to customize a plan according to each business' needs with its powerful add-ons. Their add-ons cover:
Payroll & **HR **tools
Health & Financial Benefits
Tax-Advantaged Benefits|

 How to Navigate
Response Point #1

|Many of these benefits are already included in Justworks' plans.
For example, Gusto lists Workers' Comp and 401(k) retirement savings as add-ons, but this is already included within Justworks **PEO**'s basic and plus plans. |
Response Point #2|Gusto charges for add-ons that are already included in Justworks' plans.

For example, Gusto charges for priority support at additional $8/month per person, whereas 24/7 support is already included for Justworks **PEO**'s Basic and Plus plans. Additionally, Justworks integrations are included in Plus pricing. |

2. Gusto has more health insurance carriers|
Gusto prides itself in being able to provide a wide range of affordable health insurance benefits to its customers.
More than 9,000 plans and 30+ carriers
Blue Cross Blue Shield does not work with PEOs and is a popular carrier in certain regions like Boston|

 How to Navigate
Response Point #1|Justworks **PEO **is able to provide large-group health insurance and open market plans to ensure customers' can get the best rates possible.

This means that our customers will get more rates and options to shop around their health insurance at renewals vs. Gusto and other typical **PEO **plans. |
Response Point #2|Justworks **PEO**'s benefits package is more robust than Gusto's.

Justworks **PEO **provides unique benefits options like Peloton and Kindbody that Gusto does not have. These benefits can help small businesses stand out from their competition in attracting talents. |

3. Gusto can serve more industries and is better suited for scaling|
Gusto serves an extensive list of industries that Justworks has not tapped into before. These industries include:
Churches
Nanny
Cannabis Related Business (**CRB**)|

 How to Navigate
Response Point #1|Ask about your prospect's needs and explore Justworks Payroll as a solution.

While it is true that Justworks will most likely never serve some of these industries, Justworks Payroll has made it possible to serve a much wider range of industries, such as hospitality that typically might not be a good fit for our **PEO **and co-employment offering. |
Response Point #2

|Ask about your prospects intent to grow.
Our **ATS **integrations (Greenhouse and Lever) and our accounting integrations (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite) should meet the needs with companies with small-medium growth goals. Additionally, hiring and onboarding process is best-in-class.|

4. Gusto is often seen as the cheaper solution|
Gusto's entry level solution for payroll and benefits integrations has a sticker price cheaper than Justworks Payroll and Basic plans.
View Gusto pricing on their website("https://gusto.com/product/pricing")|

 How to Navigate
Response Point #1|Ask about your prospects comfort with risk, liability, and compliance.

Gusto is not a a **PEO **and as such, does businesses will own more risk, liability, and compliance tasks than if they were under Justworks **PEO**. |
Response Point #2

|Ask about your prospects needs beyond basic payroll and benefits.
Gusto's Premium plan, which is its highest tier package, has no transparent pricing. A prospect needs to talk to Sales to get a custom quote, and it could come with hidden costs that may not be aware to the prospect and ultimately cost more than Justworks plans.

### Justworks Payroll Comparison

| How Justworks Payroll competes with Gusto |
|---|
Objection Handling (Justworks Payroll)|Gusto is cheaper
Gusto’s base level offering (now called “Simple”) is cheaper than Justworks Payroll. However, they only offer single-state payroll and very limited access to customer support so any prospect looking to pay employees in more than 1 state must upgrade to their $80/mo + $12 **PEPM **plan.
Gusto has more features that help scaling businesses
Gusto offers more health insurance carriers and integrations than Justworks Payroll, however Justworks Payroll users have the option to easily transition to Justworks **PEO **which competes with Gusto on both metrics, plus more (see Objection Handling).
Gusto has more health insurance carriers
Gusto offers 30+ carriers while the health insurance available to Justworks Payroll (open market plans brokered via Justworks) only offers 4. If the prospect is looking to shop for plans Justworks **PEO **may be a better fit (see Objection Handling)
Gusto offers more integrations
Gusto offers nearly 200 integrations across a variety of uses, such as Asana, Clover, Google Workspace, When I Work etc. Justworks Payroll only offers accounting integrations. Ask the prospect if they anticipate using integrations. If the prospect has a strong need for integrations such as **HR **integrations or additional accounting integrations Justworks **PEO **may be a better fit.|
| What is their customer support model? | Gusto’s customer support model is based on pricing tier. While their base level plan claims to offer “full support”, users report that accessing human support or faster support often costs an additional fee. “Priority support” is offered at their middle pricing tier and in order to get a dedicated **CSM **users must be on their highest priced package. |
How do our Payroll integrations and technology match up against theirs?|Technology: Gusto, like Justworks, is a tech forward company that positions its product and experiences as user friendly and intuitive.
Integrations: Gusto offers nearly 200 integrations across a variety of uses, such as Asana, Clover, Google Workspace, When I Work etc. Justworks Payroll only offers accounting integrations.|
How does our Payroll offering win against them?|Justworks customer support is award-winning
Our support has won Stevie Awards across multiple categories for six consecutive years, the world’s top honors for sales and consumer service
Our customer support is always human and always employed by Justworks - we never outsource your calls
Support response within 1 business day
Customer Satisfaction Score (**CSAT**): 4.8/5.0
No surprise fees
Multi-state payroll is included at no additional cost
No fees for off-cycle payments
No extra charge for multi-channel support for admins and employees
Easily grow with Justworks
Seamlessly move to our **PEO **product if your business needs change
With our **PEO**, provide your team access to the big- company benefits and perks they deserve - all at affordable rates
Justworks **PEO **offers proactive support for federal, state, and local employment-related compliance needs|

###  Pricing Strategy

A pillar of Justworks' brand is fairness and pricing transparency because we believe small businesses deserve better than being coerced into misleading purchases. Make sure to highlight that Paychex's revenue strategy appears to rely on lack of transparency and driving costs up through fees and add-ons.
Clear pricing transparency (it's on our website!)
Lack of hidden fees (processing fees, onboarding fees, service fees etc.)
Expert support for all users
| Pricing Tactic #1: Non-transparent pricing tiers | Paychex has three non-**PEO **pricing tiers: Essential, Select and Pro. While a base price of $39/mo + $5 **PEPM **is provided for Essential, all other pricing, including for their **PEO **product, is non-transparent and requires reaching out to a salesperson for a custom quote, |  Ask the prospect if they have a clear sense of what they will be paying Paychex based on their business needs and highlight Justworks' pricing transparency and immediate ability to get a quote. |

|---|
|
Pricing Tactic #2: Hidden fees and surprise add-ons|As part of the lack of transparency, Paychex pricing strategy relies on charging a wide variety of processing fees (set up fee, W-2 fee etc.) as well as developing custom quotes with a significant number of add-ons for functionality (benefits administration, access to integrations, time & attendance etc.). Many users report paying more than they anticipated and that it is difficult to understand Paychex invoices and what they are being charged for.

|  Inform the prospect that Paychex relies heavily on up-charging users through unexpected fees and price-gating functionality that they ascertain the prospect needs. Thus, even if you get a competitive quote from Paychex, there is no guarantee that number is what you will be asked to pay. |

 Spotting Paychex Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against Paychex—but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means |
| Scale : "750K companies use Paychex" or "Paychex pays at least 1 in 12 U.S. private sector employees” | Paychex is leveraging their scale to imply competence and reliability. What this really means is that Paychex does not give individualized attention to its users with many negative results. For example, their product is clunky and difficult to use as they are not building with their user experience and needs in mind. They also experience a lot of negative feedback about their customer service and issue resolution. Unlike with Paychex, Justworks users will never feel like just another number. |
| Legacy/experise: "50 years of **HR **experience" | Paychex cites their long history of experience in the **HR **space. What this means is practice is that their technology and business approach is outdated and users can tell (Paychex users report their product feels outdated and difficult to use). |

Paychex has a full suite of **HRIS **tools that Justworks does not have|
Paychex offers a highly comprehensive list of **HRIS **tools, including many in areas that Justworks does not have coverage such as performance management and hiring.
To learn more about Paychex's **HR **offerings see their website("https://www.paychex.com/human-resources").|
 How to Navigate
Response Point #1|Ensure the prospect fully understands their **HR **needs.

Our **HR **tools (e.g., Greenhouse and Lever integrations, onboarding tools, time tracking functions) usually more than satisfy the needs of our small business users, so I want to be sure that you aren't being sold features you will not actually end up needing.|
Response Point #2|Explain the hidden costs of Paychex's features.

Paychex charges additional fees for many of their **HR **features which can add up. Justworks does not charge any additional fees for any **HR **features or functionality and you will always know what your costs will be up front.|

Paychex offers an Administrative Services Organization (**ASO**)|
Paychex offers an **ASO **in addition to a **PEO **which provides more choices for users interested in outsourcing their **HR **responsibilities without requiring co-employment.
Read here("https://www.paychex.com/articles/human-resources/peo-vs-aso-vs-hro") to learn more about how Paychex compares a **PEO **with an **ASO**|
 How to Navigate
Response Point #1

|Ensure the prospect fully understands the differences between an **ASO **and **PEO**.
A business using an **ASO **assumes liability around all **HR **matters, including taxes, benefits and any additional federal and local compliance requirements. This creates risk for your business as well as the possibility that you will still have time consuming **HR **tasks on your plate, even when using the solution. Justworks **PEO **offers far more compliance security on top of a seamless, user-friendly experience and award-winning customer support.|
Response Point #2|Outline the different product offers that Justworks has.

If co-employment is a concern, Justworks also offers Justworks Payroll, which will also help ease the burden of administrative and compliance tasks while letting you maintain flexibility to choose the additional features and benefits that you want.|

Paychex markets a cheaper entry level solution|
Paychex Flex Essentials starts at $39 per month plus $5 per employee per month. Paychex **PEO **cost is not publically available and must be obtained by speaking to a sales associate. Justworks **PEO **Basic is $59 per month and Justworks Payroll is $50 per month plus $8 per employee per month.
For more details on Paychex Flex pricing tiers see here("https://www.paychex.com/payroll/compare-payroll-solutions")|
 How to Navigate
Response Point #1|Make sure prospects understand Paychex's products and which are comparable to Justworks' products.

Paychex Flex Essentials may appear cheaper than Justworks' products, however this is their most basic solution with very few of the features that most businesses need. This does not compare to Justworks **PEO**, and is more comparable to Justworks Payroll (which also has more features compared to Paychex base offering).|
Response Point #2|Explain how Paychex non-transparent pricing may impact them.

Paychex does not have transparent pricing, so while $39/mo (+$5 **PEPM**) is the price they show on their website, it is highly likely that any quote that you get from them will be higher if not much higher than that price.|

My first payroll with Paychex went just fine and I was pleased with the service. Since then they've given me a new dedicated service person every 1-2 months. When I try to reach them they're unavailable or a new one has been assigned. If I get a call back and I'm not available they don't leave a message so it appears to be a spam call.

## ✅ Leading Questions & Talking Points

View Executive Summary here("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/53936/#")

Our pricing is transparent and straightforward
| Leading Question to Ask | Talking Points |
Pricing
Are you aware of how Paychex prices their solutions and services?
Are you confident that your quote from Paychex is all inclusive of all of the features you will be using?|Justworks breaks out and provides visibility into all service/insurance costs, making it easy to identify and pay for only what you need.
Paychex is not transparent with pricing - new customers must speak to a representative to understand product packaging and pricing and Paychex users report that they are paying more than they anticipated for features and it is challenging to interpret their invoices and what they are being charged for.|

Our technology is modern and user friendly
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Technology & Usability
How important is it to you that your **PEO**/payroll/**HR **system is easy to use?
Have you walked through the Paychex product experience? Do you feel comfortable you know how to use it?|Justworks' platform is intuitive and user-friendly no matter which product you're using so you won't need to spend time and resources training employees to use the tool.
Paychex's legacy platform is not intuitive and does not meet the standards of a modern workforce. Coupled with lackluster onboarding support (that comes with a fee), this presents platform usability challenges for customers based on G2 reviews.|

Our award-winning customer service far outperforms competitors
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Customer Service
How important is quality customer service to you?
Have you ever had a poor customer service experience with your payroll provider, **PEO **or **HR **solutions provider? If so, did this create issues for your business?
|Our customer service is world-class - Our team is award-winning and has been recognized through the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service("https://www.justworks.com/about/press/archive/justworks-wins-2023-gold-stevie-award"), the world’s top honors for customer service and sales professionals. Justworks recently won:
Gold for Best Use of Technology in Customer Service
Silver for Customer Service Department of the Year - Computer Software
Silver for Achievement in Customer Service Automation
Bronze for Achievement in Customer Experience
We take a human approach to service - building our support model with you in mind. In contrast, Paychex, while they do offer 24/7 support, has a disconnected service model, with different contacts for payroll, insurance, and HR. Smaller customers often spend significant time and energy to get the support they need. Many customers report challenges with customer service on G2 reviews.|
 International deep dive

| How Justworks International competes with Paychex |
|---|
| What international service offerings do they have, if any? | Paychex offers International Payroll |
| Do they have an all-in-one platform experience for US/global teams? If yes, is it directly or through third party partnerships? | Paychex does not offer an all-in-one solution. Their Payroll offering is done through local partners. They previously had a partnership with Globalization Partners. |
| What do we know about the pricing of their offering? | Pricing is not available, and customers must request a quote. |
How do we position ourselves to win?|Our all-in one solution provides a comprehensive suite of services

How do our Payroll integrations and technology match up against theirs?|Technology: Users report that Paychex technology is very outdated and difficult to use.
Integrations: Paychex offers a significant number of integrations across a variety of functions via two-way or flat file **API**. |
How does our Payroll offering win against them?|Price transparency
Paychex does not have transparent pricing and may charge “setup” fees for things like company account setup and implementation as well as other process fees such as for 1099 payments or W-2 filings. Justworks Payroll offers transparent pricing, including for all add-ons like state tax registration, time tracking and benefits, with no hidden fees.
User experience
Users often complain of Paychex’s “confusing UX”, which can make the platform difficult to use as well as lead to inefficiencies and errors.
Justworks customer support is award-winning
Our support has won Stevie Awards across multiple categories for six consecutive years, the world’s top honors for sales and consumer service. Our customer support is always human and always employed by Justworks - we never outsource your calls. Support response within 1 business day. Customer Satisfaction Score (**CSAT**): 4.8/5.0.|

Industry:Professional Services

###  Pricing Strategy

Justworks' pricing is transparent whereas Paylocity forces customers to sign up for a demo before they can get a quote. Furthermore, while Paylocity boasts of having an all-in-one solution, customers have to pay for additional features and integrations to make it truly comprehensive—so the costs rack up. To deposition on price, highlight how Paylocity’s pricing model relies on charging for add-ons and integrations.
| Pricing Tactic #1: Lack of transparency | There is no pricing information on Paylocity’s website. Instead, Paylocity claims—depending on the features selected for the plan—that pricing is per employee per month (**PEPM**) so cost per employee doesn’t change as the company grows. |  Inform prospects that they must request a demo and a quote in order to get a ballpark figure for cost. |

|---|---|
| Pricing Tactic #2: Hidden fees | Paylocity’s claim that **PEPM **doesn’t increase “depending on the features” alludes to its strategy of charging for add-ons customers need to build out the customized solutions Paylocity promises. |  Show medium-sized prospects that our **PEPM **decreases once they hit 50 customers. For all prospects, highlight plan features we include for free that Paylocity either charges for or lacks, highlighting: |

HR & accounting integrations
Contractor onboarding and payment (domestic and international)
24/7 support
|

 Spotting Paylocity Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against Paylocity—but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means |
| Scalable infrastructure | Paylocity says its infrastructure scales as businesses grow so customers won't outgrow it. |
| Innovative/modern | Paylocity says it constantly invests in new features so that it can continue to innovate for customers and provide cutting-edge technology. |

1. Paylocity supports more integrations|
Has an integration marketplace("https://www.paylocity.com/our-products/integrations/marketplace/") with 350+ **HR **and payroll options.
Has open APIs("https://www.paylocity.com/our-products/integrations/apis-developer-resources/") for building custom integrations.|
 How to Navigate
Response Point #1|Identify which integrations the prospect cares about.

We have found that our partner list more than suits the vast majority of our prospects. Odds are, we have them covered. Our **ATS **integrations (Greenhouse, JazzHR, and Lever) and our accounting integrations (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Sage Intacct) should meet the needs with companies with small-medium growth goals.|
Response Point #2|Explain the hidden costs of add-ons.

Paylocity's pricing is opaque, and they're known to charge customers additional fees for more features. Its integrations—some of which are needed to have a truly all-in-one solution—also carry additional fees. (Ex: Maxwell Health integration costs $10 per pay period("https://resourcecenter.maxwellhealth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035348414-About-the-Paylocity-360-**API**-Integration#h_8605fcd5-c831-4199-a955-9800c7206442").) All of Justworks' integrations are free.|

2. Paylocity is better at scaling with businesses|
Offers solutions specifically for small, mid-sized, and enterprise businesses.
All-in-one **HCM **system has flexible features, such as payroll, to support scaling.
Businesses can leverage integrations to tailor the platform to serve their needs.
Named a G2 enterprise leader in Spring 2023.|
 How to Navigate

Response Point #2

|Talk about transparent pricing.
Justworks' global **EOR **costs $599/month per month and has no hidden fees, additional fees, or minimum employee requirements. Paylocity's opaque pricing makes it difficult to know how much it will cost to hire and pay international employees through the platform. Additionally, Paylocity's entry level Payroll offering does not include multistate compliance support.|

TrustPilot Review
Paylocity was given a 1-star review on TrustPilot
Really cant say enough bad things. Onboarding was absolute hell. Would get 5 different answers for something until it finally worked, and even then it worked a couple of times then would have issues again. We still have 2-3 employees out of 10-15 not able to clock in every day. Every day there is a new issue. Time and labor is basically a whole different company from Payroll. Have to do...

Terrible company. They sell you on hassle free service. when we signed up they told us we could send in our payroll every month every month. when we sent the payroll in with fewer employees even though they were no longer with the company. When we finally got involved the website was difficult to navigate. There were also labor intense processes required to terminate the employees. The system...

Paylocity was down (with a website message stating it was down) and had a link to check the status. The status page stated “Error: Unable to load applications” **AND** “All Systems Operational” at the same time. There was a link to email Paylocity. I did so. I received an automated email stating my email address was not an administrator, my email was not delivered, and I would receive no reply.

Our customer service team is more responsive and reliable than Paylocity's
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Responsive
What are you looking for in terms of customer service?
|Justworks’ customer service team is more responsive than Paylocity, which can leave customers waiting a week("https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/127rc7t/comment/jehkql7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button") for a response over email. Meanwhile, Justworks customers regularly praise how quickly they receive help.
Justworks' customers can reach support 24/7 through various channels: phone, email, Slack, and their **CSM**. Paylocity doesn't have Slack support, and phone support is only available through Friday 6:00AM — 7:30PM, Central Time.|
Reliable
What are you looking for in terms of customer service?
|Justworks' customer support is very knowledgeable("https://www.g2.com/products/justworks/reviews/justworks-review-8386081") so customers get resolutions to their issues. Paylocity customers complain about their problems not being fixed due to high account manager turnover and lack of expertise.

How important is it for you to have an easy to use product and self service?|Justworks outranks Paylocity("https://www.g2.com/compare/justworks-vs-paylocity") in Ease of Use on G2 and has a higher overall rating.
Justworks’ interface is specifically built/designed to be intuitive so customers’ processes and workflows are streamlined("https://www.g2.com/products/justworks/reviews/justworks-review-8790740").

|---|

Our pricing is more transparent than Paylocity's
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Pricing
Are you aware how Paylocity charges for its solution and add-ons?|Paylocity isn't transparent on pricing at all, only saying that pricing is dependent on the features selected for the plan
Reviews on G2 show that Paylocity has hidden charges for extra features ("https://www.g2.com/products/paylocity/reviews/paylocity-review-8038028")that customers need in order to get maximum value of the product. For example, customers have to pay extra for custom reports("https://www.g2.com/products/paylocity/reviews/paylocity-review-8762130").

### Justworks Payroll Comparison

| How Justworks Payroll competes with Paylocity |
|---|
Objection Handling (Justworks Payroll)|Paylocity supports more integrations
One of Paylocity’s core value propositions is their wide network of integrations including open APIs for building custom integrations. While some larger prospects may desire these features, many small businesses will not need nor want to pay additional fees for supporting and building complex integrations. The prospect does require integrations that Justworks Payroll does not offer, Justworks **PEO **may be a great fit.
Paylocity is better at scaling with businesses
Many of Paylocity’s features and tools are built with enterprise companies in mind. If the prospect is an enterprise company, Justworks is likely not a great fit. If the prospect is a company under 100 employees with ambitious growth goals, it is very likely that the features, integrations and tools offered by Justworks **PEO **will work for them. (See Objection Handling)
Paylocity has more experience with people analytics and reporting
Paylocity offers a wide range of reporting including reports on demographic data, labor costs, bubble chart analysis of leading turnover trends, real-time employee data and performance metrics and more, plus the ability to build custom reports. If your prospect needs advanced reporting capabilities, Justworks **PEO **may be a good fit for them (see Objection Handling).
Paylocity supports international payroll and compliance
Paylocity offers integrated global payroll across 100+ countries and global support with access to "in-country experts.” If the prospect has full time international employees, Justworks **PEO **may be a good fit for them (see Objection Handling). |
| What is their customer support model? | Users report that Paylocity’s customer support can leave customers waiting a week for a response over email. There is also a report of high account manager turnover and lack of expertise with the customer service representatives leading to frustration. While not public on their website, users report that hands on support like dedicated onboarding support costs extra. |
How do our Payroll integrations and technology match up against theirs?|Integrations: Paylocity has an integration marketplace with 350+ **HR **and payroll options as well as open APIs for building custom integrations. Justworks Payroll only offers accounting integrations.
Technology: Users report that Paylocity’s technology is clunky, non-intuitive and difficult to learn. Businesses that do not pay for onboarding support report having a great deal of difficulty understanding how to get started.|
How does our Payroll offering win against them?|Our onboarding/implementation process is seamless
Justworks makes onboarding/implementation seamless:
Implementation doesn’t require **IT **support and our easy-to-use interface is highly intuitive
Our dedicated Onboarding team provides responsive support throughout the process.
Many Paylocity customers have shared frustrating, mistake-ridden onboarding/implementation experiences on G2 and Reddit.
Our customer service team is more responsive and reliable than Paylocity's
Our support has won Stevie Awards across multiple categories for six consecutive years, the world’s top honors for sales and consumer service. Our customer support is always human and always employed by Justworks - we never outsource your calls. Support response within 1 business day. Customer Satisfaction Score (**CSAT**): 4.8/5.0.
Our platform is easier to use than Paylocity's
Justworks outranks Paylocity in Ease of Use on G2 and has a higher overall rating. Justworks’ interface is specifically built/designed to be intuitive so customers’ processes and workflows are streamlined. Our intuitive functionality cuts down on the time customers need to spend on tasks because they aren’t clicking around endlessly like they do in Paylocity.

###  Pricing Strategy

Both Justworks and Deel list simple to understand pricing. Deel lists the starting price, insinuating that the price could be high, but there is no context of how high it could go. Justworks price is the final price. The pricing page lists,
| Pricing Tactic #1: Semi-transparent pricing | Deel's fees are semi-transparent. **EOR **has a starting price of $599/month, **PEO **starts at $95/month and domestic contractors start at $49/month, but no indication of what would cause the price to increase. You have to speak to sales to get a final price. | Ask about: |

|---|
Ask the customer what is included in their quote and if all features included are required.
Are they paying for features they don't need?|
Pricing Tactic #2: Free **HRIS **platform|Deel offers their **HRIS **platform for free to teams of up to 200.

|Ask about:
Do they need a robust **HRIS **for the team? Especially if they are less than 20.
What features and integrations are most important to them? |
Pricing Tactic #3: Exorbitant termination fees|Deel charges additional fees when terminating employees through their Employer of Record (**EOR**) platform, which can become quite costly. Standard termination involves a fee equivalent to one month’s management fees, with additional charges for complex terminations or terminations within the first six months of employment.

Executive Summary here("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/53937/#")

1. Deel has more expertise and country coverage.|
Details: Deel boasts of access to a market-leading coverage with 120+ entities worldwide. If we don't offer coverage in the country a **SMB **plans to hire, we may lose.
 How to Navigate

2. Deel offers a free **HRIS **platform—why pay?|
Details: Deel **HR **is free and provides most basic **HRIS **functionality needed for global teams.

Free **HR **tools may be appealing but it doesn’t replace hands-on customer support and compliance expertise.
Justworks does offer **HRIS **features and integrations that generally meet the needs of most SMBs and we complement our software with dedicated customer support for both admins and employees and **HR **Consulting—giving you both a platform and people for you and the team to get help when you need it.
Additionally, Deel may charge you for additional fees for things like Deel Shield, onboarding fees, and payroll processing fees. |

3. Deel supports payments in multiple currencies and offers features like crypto payments and advanced withdrawals.|
Details: Deel has more robust payment features including more payment types("https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/10636324081041-Managing-Payment-Methods#:~:text=If%20they%20are%20adding%20a,%2C%20Wise%2C%20or%20Mercury%20account.") and more flexible withdrawal policies.

From the start, we faced challenges enrolling employees in health insurance, and even after initial setup, renewals proved difficult to navigate. It was often hard to get support by phone, so we had to rely on email or chat-based systems that sometimes prematurely marked issues as resolved—only to be passed off to another...

It’s now June 4th, and she **STILL **hasn’t been paid. What makes it worse? Deel’s response: “We’ll investigate, it may take a day.” A day?!

## ✅ How We Win

Get Leading Questions & Talking Points here("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/54991/#")

We win against Nextep on these fronts|
Our reputation & values are highly ranked in the **PEO **industry.|
Our pricing is transparent and straightforward. |
Our customer service and onboarding team are best-in-class.|

## ⚠️ Why We Lose

See Objection Handling for more details("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/54991/#")

Common Objections|
Nextep has better rates.|
Nextep is a local **PEO**.|

###  Competitor Profile

nextep.com.png
Nextep•nextep.com("http://nextep.com/")

Nextep is a top **PEO **providing HR, benefits, payroll, and compliance solutions to businesses, empowering growth and supporting employees.
Estimated Annual Revenue:$10M-$50M
Employee Count:300
Industry Group:Commercial & Professional Services
Company Type:Private
Location:1800 N Interstate Dr, Norman, **OK **73072, **USA**
Industry:Professional Services
Founded:1997
Sector:Industrials
Sub Industry:Human Resource & Employment Services

###  Pricing Strategy

Unlike Nextep, we are confident in showing our transparent pricing, without the prospect requesting a quote. To de-position on price, highlight how Nextep costs can add up. We include the below features our Basic plan, and Nextep doesn't:
Telehealth
**HR **Consulting
**PTO **Management
| Pricing Tactic #1: Semi-transparent pricing | On its website, Nextep claims to have transparent pricing, but their website only offers pricing for "additional services & assessments". |  Inform the prospect that if they're interested in insurance and benefits, they must 1) request a quote and 2) figure out how much their modular plan will cost. |

|---|---|
| Pricing Tactic #2: Lowball pricing on health insurance and admin fees | Nextep markets competitive health insurances rates, but make up for the difference in other parts of their business due to self-insured plans. This can cause for volatile renewals. Also, their admin fees increase by $3 **PEPM**, each year. |  Show a true apples-to-apples comparison and highlight the full list of services that our Basic plan includes, compared to Nextep. Prospects will see how much more they get with Justworks, and that we are transparent with pricing. |

Our renewal caps (when applicable) can be a great way to display our stable pricing in the long term.|
See sample Nextep quote here("https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vLJIEXVr7NhQN5_frcw9Jn1I7-3Q920H1D62N6aWDnU/edit").
 Spotting Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against Nextep - but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means | Objection Handling |
| **IRS**-certified | The term “certified professional employer organization” (**CPEO**) means that the Internal Revenue Service (**IRS**) has certified the **PEO **as meeting the applicable requirements. Nextep likes to promote this certification as a big reason why a business should work with them. | Justworks is also **IRS**-certified and **ESAC **Accredited. Justworks is subject to stringent operational and financial standards set by the **IRS **and **ESAC**. |
| The prospect asks where we are located | This is typically a precursor to the prospect asking if we have someone located in Texas. For some prospects, having a local partner is attractive, and Nextep plays this as a benefit. | We are willing to travel and we have an in-market team in Austin. |
|
 Objection Handling

1. Nextep has better rates|
Nextep offers Aetna and will often undercut pricing to win business.
They don't always operate with parity, so make sure to ask for a proposal.|

 How to Navigate
| Response Point #1 | Ask them what carriers they are looking for. We offer competitive health insurance rates through our master policies on our **PEO **product. Our carriers include Aetna, Kaiser Permanente, and UnitedHealthcare. If you want a specific carrier like, Blue Cross Blue Shield, we may be able to get you a plan through the open market. |

| Response Point #2 | Let them know we can help them shop around. When we run health insurance quotes, we will explore both carriers available on our master policy and through the health insurance open market. Both have comparable coverage and we will work with you to make sure you find the plans that fit the needs of your team and your budget. |

Response Point #3

|Make sure that we are quoting based on the same factors. A smaller **PEO **may offer lowball rates but they will have volatile renewals. Make sure that we are capturing the same information so that quotes are as stable as possible.
|

2. Nextep is a local **PEO**|
Share that we frequently visit and host events in the area.
Ask for an in-person meeting
Share details of recent or upcoming events|

 How to Navigate
Response Point #1

| Explain that we are a national business - You have a **TX **territory and frequently visit. It's your priority to know the territory well and want them to feel that they are in good hands. |
| Response Point #2 | Share a case study or testimonial - Ask a teammate for a local business willing to share a case study or testimonial. These can be powerful in making the prospect feel comfortable doing business with us. |


## ✅ Leading Questions & Talking Points

|

Our pricing is transparent and straight-forward
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Pricing
Are you aware of how Nextep prices their solutions and service?|Justworks breaks out and provides visibility into all service/insurance costs, making it easy to identify and pay for only what you need. Nextep has a pricing model that increases $3 **PEPM **each year vs. Justworks' flat per employee per month model.

| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Customer service
How important is customer service for you and your employees?|Our customer service is world-class - clients love the 24/7 U.S.based support and Account Managers.

###  Pricing Strategy

Both Justworks and Remote list simple to understand pricing. Remote lists the starting price, insinuating that the price could be high, but there is no context of how high it could go. Justworks price is the final price. The pricing page lists,
Admin fees and associated features
Add-on fees
| Pricing Tactic: Semi-transparent pricing | Remote's fees are semi-transparent. **EOR **has a starting price of $599/month, and Remote Talent start at $119/month, but no indication of what would cause the price to increase. You have to speak to sales to get a final price. |  What to do to deposition |
|---|
Ask the customer what is included in their quote and if all features included are required.
In other words, are they paying for features they don't need?|

 Spotting Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against Remote - but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means | Objection Handling |
| Payroll Anywhere | Remote boasts about their owned entities in 170+ countries. | Are you hiring everywhere? Or do you prefer expert support is specific places? |
| Global **HR **Platform | Remote positions itself as serving teams distributed worldwide, claiming to specialize in **HR **in many countries. | Compliance requires specialization and experience. is Remote the best partner for US-based businesses, with most of their workforce in the US. |


## ⚙️ Product Comparison

Compare page is coming to the Justworks website soon! Please check back for updates.

 Objection Handling

1. Remote has more country coverage|
Remote boasts of access to a market-leading coverage with 170+ entities worldwide. Owned entities in each country means:
they can control the level of service
they can control costs|

 How to Navigate
Response Point #1| Ask where your prospects either have employees abroad or plan to hire.

We have **EOR **entities in top talent markets like—Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, France, India, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the U.K—and we're adding more. We also have local partners in 100+ countries that can help customers with hiring upon request. We may have the support they need in that country/countries.|

2. Remote offers more international solutions|
Remote offers global payroll which in situations where customers need both global payroll and **EOR**, we lose.
Remote offers Contractor Management Plus, which allows indemnity protection of up to $100k per contractor and compliance with local laws.|

 How to Navigate
Response Point #1

|Ask them what are their international payroll and hiring needs?
While we cannot compete with global payroll and indemnity solutions (today), **SMB**'s might only need contractors or to hire international employees in a few counties where we have an all-in-one solution for that can give these employees payroll, benefits, and **HR **support.|
Response Point #2|Ask them what level of customer support they want and are available with their free **HRIS **service?

Justworks is committed to building the best 24/7 customer support, data protection, and transparent fees specifically for small businesses—features that tend not to be included in a free platform. In the case that a **SMB **is exploring International services in countries we support, our customer service is a key differentiator to ensure business success.|

## ✅ Leading Questions & Talking Points

Executive Summary here.("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/59167/#")

Justworks Payroll technology is modern and user friendly
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Technology
| How much bandwidth do you have to support your software set-up and initial implementation? | Quickbooks’ platform was originally created for accountants, so it has the potential of being too complicated for small businesses that need simplicity and ease of use. It requires a lot of configuration if you want it to work the way it’s sold. |

Our award-winning customer service far outperforms competitors
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Customer Service
How important is quality customer service to you?
Have you ever had a poor customer service experience with your payroll provider, **PEO **or **HR **solutions provider? If so, did this create issues for your business?|Our customer service is world-class - Our team is award-winning and has been recognized through the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service("https://www.justworks.com/about/press/archive/justworks-wins-2023-gold-stevie-award"), the world’s top honors for customer service and sales professionals. Justworks recently won:
Gold for Best Use of Technology in Customer Service
Silver for Customer Service Department of the Year - Computer Software
Silver for Achievement in Customer Service Automation
Bronze for Achievement in Customer Experience
We take a human approach to service - building our support model with you in mind. In contrast, Quickbooks, while they do offer 24/7 support, has a disconnected service model, with different contacts for payroll and HR. Smaller customers often spend significant time and energy to get the support they need. Many customers report challenges with customer service on G2 reviews.|

Justworks' platform is built to help small businesses grow with confidence
| Leading Question to Ask | Talking Points |
Built for small businesses
What are you looking for in terms of a business partner and compliance support?|Justworks has a longstanding history as an accredited **PEO **provider and is there for when a small business is ready to take the next step.
Moving to our **PEO **would come with more competitive benefits, compliance support, less business rick and international workforce solutions.
Justworks earns **ESAC**-accredited **PEO **status for financial stability, regulatory-compliant operations, and ethical conduct.|

Justworks offers more robust benefits to provide a seamless experience
| Leading Question to Ask | Talking Points |
Premium benefits
How important are robust employee benefits to your business?|Justworks prioritizes equitable and accessible benefits.
We provide insurance through national carriers and providers that often have virtual care options, without having to go through a broker.

## ✅ How We Win

Get Leading Questions & Talking Points here("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/58395/#")

We win on these fronts|
We provide enterprise level benefits that are typically not available to small businesses.|
Our pricing is transparent and straightforward|
Our homegrown technology is modern and user-friendly|
Our world-class, 24/7 customer service far outperforms Employer Flexible's limited hours|


## ⚠️ Why We Lose

See Objection Handling for more details("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/58395/#")

Common Objections|
Employer Flexible is a local **PEO**.|
Employer offers better insurance rates.|


###  Competitor Profile

employerflexible.com.png
Employer Flexible•employerflexible.com("http://employerflexible.com/")

Employer Flexible provides comprehensive human resources and business solutions, including **PEO **services, recruitment, and **IT **support, designed to enhance organizational efficiency and employee satisfaction.
Estimated Annual Revenue:$10M-$50M
Employee Count:240
Industry Group:Commercial & Professional Services
Company Type:Private
Location:7850 North Sam Houston Pkwy W #100, Houston, **TX **77064, **USA**

Industry:Professional Services
Founded:2003
Sector:Industrials
Sub Industry:Human Resource & Employment Services

###  Pricing Strategy

Unlike Employer Flexible, we are confident in showing our transparent pricing, without the prospect requesting a quote. To de-position on price, highlight how Employer Flexible costs can add up.
Pricing Tactic #1: Pricing is not transparent|Their website makes no mention of pricing or packages.

|  Inform the prospect that if they're interested in insurance and benefits, they must 1) request a quote and 2) figure out how much their plan will cost. |
| Pricing Tactic #2: Lowball pricing on health insurance | Employer Flexible markets competitive health insurances rates, but we have seen several cases where they violate max savings rules. This can cause for volatile renewals. |  Show a true apples-to-apples comparison and highlight the full list of services that our Basic plan includes, compared to Employer Flexible. Prospects will see how much more they get with Justworks, and that we are transparent with pricing. |

Our renewal caps (when applicable) can be a great way to display our stable pricing in the long term.|
 Spotting Buzzwords

If you hear these terms frequently, we're likely up against Employer Flexible - but not a guarantee.
| Buzzwords | What it means | Objection Handling |
MyHR|MyHR is the name of their proprietary platform.  Their **PEO **is homegrown. They offer a mobile app for users with the following features:
Digital insurance cards and benefits information
Employee payroll access
Secure account
One-touch benefits access
Real-time payroll access
Push notifications
Facial recognition login
| View paystubs, W-2 and more | Justworks' platform is also homegrown and constantly updated to meet the needs of our customers. |
|---|
| The prospect asks where we are located | This is typically a precursor to the prospect asking if we have someone located in Texas. For some prospects, having a local partner is attractive, and Employer Flexible plays this as a benefit. | We are willing to travel and we have an in-market team in Austin. |


## ⚙️ Product Comparison

Share this compare page with prospects for a side-by-side comparison("https://justworks.highspot.com/items/621e3d10549513e2700a0d35?lfrm=srp.0"): Justworks vs. Employer Flexible("https://www.justworks.com/compare/justworks-vs-employer-flexible")
 Objection Handling

1. Employer Flexible is a local **PEO**.|
Share that we frequently visit and host events in the area.
Ask for an in-person meeting
Share details of recent or upcoming events
Our 24/7 customer support is more accessible than any local provider|

 How to Navigate
Response Point #1|Explain that we are a national business with 24/7 customer support - 24/7 support is more accessible than any local provider.

You also have a **TX **territory and frequently visit. It's your priority to know the territory well and want them to feel that they are in good hands.|
| Response Point #2 | Share a case study or testimonial - Ask a teammate for a local business willing to share a case study or testimonial. These can be powerful in making the prospect feel comfortable doing business with us. |

2. Employer Flexible offers better insurance rates.|
Employer Flexible have quoted lowball rates, and on several occasions have violated max savings/rules of underwriting for sales.|

 How to Navigate
Response Point #1

| Let them know we can help them shop around. When we run health insurance quotes, we will explore both carriers available on our master policy and through the health insurance open market. Both have comparable coverage and we will work with you to make sure you find the plans that fit the needs of your team and your budget. |
| Response Point #2 | Ask them what carriers they are looking for. We offer competitive health insurance rates through our master policies on our **PEO **product. Our carriers include Aetna, Kaiser Permanente, and UnitedHealthcare. If you want a specific carrier like, Blue Cross Blue Shield, we may be able to get you a plan through the open market. |

| Response Point #3 | Make sure that we are quoting based on the same factors. A smaller **PEO **may offer lowball rates but they will have volatile renewals. Make sure that we are capturing the same information so that quotes are as stable as possible. |

 International offering

| How Justworks International competes with Employer Flexible |

## ✅ How We Win

Get Leading Questions & Talking Points here("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/60907/#")

We win on these fronts|
Justworks offers a reputable and homegrown **PEO**.|
Our pricing is transparent and straightforward.|
Our world-class, 24/7 customer service far outperforms BambooHR's limited availability.|
Justworks has an all-in-one International offering.|


## ⚠️ Why We Lose

See Objection Handling for more details("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/60907/#")

Common Objections|
BambooHR provides a robust assortment of **HR **integrations|
BambooHR offers tools for hiring like an Applicant Tracking System|
BambooHR has more add-ons that help businesses customize their plans|


###  Competitor Profile

Estimated Annual Revenue:$100M-$250M
Founded:2008

Company Type:Private
Location:333 S 520 W, Lindon, **UT **84042-1877, US
Industry:Professional Services

###  Pricing Strategy

We are confident in showing our transparent pricing, without the prospect requesting a quote. Highlight how BambooHR uses "bundled discount" pricing to charge customers for features they don't need.
| Pricing Tactic #1: Bundle & save | Get a 15% discount when you combine Payroll and Benefits Administration with the Core or Pro plan |  This can be misleading, as the base price is not advertised, so the only way to know the true discount is by requesting a quote. |

|---|---|
Pricing Tactic #2: Variable pricing models|Variable pricing models

|  Point out that pricing is dependent on number of employees. Companies with more than 25 employees are priced at a **PEPM **basis. For companies with 25 employees or fewer, **HR **software pricing is a flat monthly rate. |

TrustPilot Review
OnPay was given a 2-star review on TrustPilot
When it works, it works well. But if you have a problem, this is the worst company to deal with. -If you catch them in the morning, hold time is just 30mins. Later in the day, I've been on hold for 45mins. -The ticketing system is a sham. You have to log the ticket and then call to get their attention on the ticket. If you don't consistently follow up your ticket will be closed without even you...

TrustPilot Review
OnPay was given a 1-star review on TrustPilot
My employees have two rates. Onpay claimed to offer a system for payroll for blended overtime rate or weighted average. However, their system does not calculate this for **PTO **or Sick Leave. I submitted a ticket and response was they can't do it and won't try to do it, case closed. Now searching for another payroll service that can.

TrustPilot Review
OnPay was given a 1-star review on TrustPilot
It is impossible to cancel the service. Their web site offers no feature to cancel instead, directing you to either calling them or submitting a support ticket. I have called a half dozen times over the last month and end up hanging up after an hour on hold or after my call is dropped all together. When you create a support ticket and hit submit, nothing happens...no acknowledgement, no message...

They never pick up the phone on Fridays or after year end so you can get help for payroll or taxes. Very bad!

TrustPilot Review
OnPay was given a 1-star review on TrustPilot
This is hands down the worst payroll company I've ever worked with. Don't be fooled by these reviews. They don't file 941's on time. When you ask for an update it's a 6 week lead time minimum for the tax team to get to this. You call on the phone and it's at least a half an hour hold time. Go somewhere else you'll save yourself anxiety, stress and time.

## ✅ Leading Questions & Talking Points

Executive Summary here.("https://app.crayon.co/embed/just-works/battlecard/61191/#")

Justworks Payroll technology is modern and user friendly
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Technology
| How much bandwidth do you have to support your software set-up and initial implementation? | OnPay's platform was originally created for accountants, so it has the potential of being too complicated for small businesses that need simplicity and ease of use. It requires a lot of configuration if you want it to work the way it’s sold. |

Our award-winning customer service far outperforms competitors
| ## Leading Questions to Ask | Talking Points |

Customer Service
How important is quality customer service to you?
Have you ever had a poor customer service experience with your payroll provider, **PEO **or **HR **solutions provider? If so, did this create issues for your business?|Our customer service is world-class - Our team is award-winning and has been recognized through the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service("https://www.justworks.com/about/press/archive/justworks-wins-2023-gold-stevie-award"), the world’s top honors for customer service and sales professionals. Justworks recently won:
Gold for Best Use of Technology in Customer Service
Silver for Customer Service Department of the Year - Computer Software
Silver for Achievement in Customer Service Automation
Bronze for Achievement in Customer Experience
We take a human approach to service - building our support model with you in mind. In contrast, OnPay offers 9am - 8pm weekday support, has a disconnected service model, with different contacts for payroll and HR. Smaller customers often spend significant time and energy to get the support they need. Many customers report challenges with customer service on G2 reviews.|

Justworks' platform is built to help small businesses grow with confidence
| Leading Question to Ask | Talking Points |
Built for small businesses
What are you looking for in terms of a business partner and compliance support?|Justworks has a longstanding history as an accredited **PEO **provider and is there for when a small business is ready to take the next step.
Moving to our **PEO **would come with more competitive benefits, compliance support, less business rick and international workforce solutions.
Justworks earns **ESAC**-accredited **PEO **status for financial stability, regulatory-compliant operations, and ethical conduct.|

Justworks offers more robust benefits to provide a seamless experience
| Leading Question to Ask | Talking Points |
Premium benefits
How important are robust employee benefits to your business?|Justworks prioritizes equitable and accessible benefits.
We provide insurance through national carriers and providers that often have virtual care options, without having to go through a broker.
We work with partners like Kindbody, Talkspace, and One Medical to ensure that regardless if an employee is looking for fertility care or mental health services, we always have an option for all employees.|
Additional solutions
| Are you aware of Justworks' add-ons and integrations? | Only Justworks offers small businesses additional solutions like standalone payroll or global workforce solutions through our employer of record and contractor services. With our available add-ons and integrations spanning from time-tracking, Greenhouse to contractor payments, we offer more flexibility than your typical **PEO**. |
